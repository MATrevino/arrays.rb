# Self Evaluation #

1. I feel fairly confident about Arrays so far. I think it's challenging to know where I'm running things and how to see if my array methods work without seeing the action.
2. Not that I can think of. I tried to really focus during this lesson. I think during the 3 week break, I would like to work more on these activities.
3. I think I just need more time to work with arrays. No questions at this time.
